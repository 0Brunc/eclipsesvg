# Hi!! ðŸ‘‹

This project is my very first SVG animation, it was made for a front-end coding challenge.
This project makes use of masks, it changes coordinates, colours and oppacities for transitions. It is also made with accesibility in mind!

[Live Demo](https://eclipsesvg.netlify.app)

## Description
