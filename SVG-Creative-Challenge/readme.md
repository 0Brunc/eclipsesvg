# Hi!! ðŸ‘‹

This project is my very first SVG animation, it was made for a front-end coding challenge.
This project makes use of masks, it changes coordinates, colours and oppacities for transitions. It is also made with accesibility in mind!

## Description

There's a woman looking out the window of a building while a annular solar eclipse occurs.

(This version is a more complete than what was delivered, I didnÂ´t have much time but later on I finished what I couldnÂ´t do)
